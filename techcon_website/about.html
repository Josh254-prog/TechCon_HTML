            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of local tech enthusiasts in a university auditorium.
                Its initial aim was to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration within the nascent tech community.
                Over the years, it steadily grew, attracting speakers and attendees from across the region,
                and by 2015, it had become a nationally recognized event. The conference has consistently evolved
                with the industry, incorporating new tracks on AI, blockchain, cybersecurity, and sustainable tech,
                solidifying its reputation as a forward-thinking platform for technological discourse and innovation.
